# Perceptions of Diversity in Electronic Music: the Impact of Listener, Artist, and Track Characteristics

This repository has been created to foster the reproducibility of results for the experiment described in submission 3238 to the CSCW 2021 conference. 
It contains raw data and code to replicate the experiment described in the submitted paper. 

At the time of the submission, documentation is still not available, and it will be updated before the submission of the camera-ready version, in case of acceptance. 


#### Installation:
Create a virtual environment (tested on Python 3.8), then launch the following command for installing the dependencies:
 ```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
 ```
